# Overview
This project is an interactive web application for generating guitar chords and learning guitar theories. When I was studying guitar on my own, I realized that it would be helpful to have an interactive tool to follow along when learning fretboard interval relationships. All the available chord generators on the market only showed the chords and never explained why the chords are constructed that way, so I made one myself.
